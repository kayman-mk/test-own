            Thank you for your contribution to GitLab. Please refer to the contribution flow documentation for a quick overview of the process, and the merge request (MR) guidelines for the detailed process.
Some contributions require several iterations of review and we try to mentor contributors
during this process. However, we understand that some reviews can be very time consuming.
If you would prefer for us to continue the work you've submitted now or at any point in the
future please let us know.
If you're okay with being part of our review process (and we hope you are!), there are
several initial checks we ask you to make:

The merge request description clearly explains:

The problem being solved.
The best way a reviewer can test your changes (is it possible to provide an example?).


If the pipeline failed, do you need help identifying what failed?
Check that Go code follows our Go guidelines.
